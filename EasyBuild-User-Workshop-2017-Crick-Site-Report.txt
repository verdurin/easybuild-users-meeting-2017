Intro to Crick

My background
- FLS, Manchester, mainly RPM packaging
- Imperial/CNS
  - highly-domain specific application provisioning
- Crick
  - EasyBuild/Lmod
  - diversity of legacy clusters and experiences, many of which include no
    modules and instead symbolic links to the latest or preferred version
  - have to introduce the concept and benefits of modules
  - some groups e.g. BABS take to it much more quickly, after some initial
    complaints
  - benefits of 1:1 training with research groups
  - Van Loo
    - used on eMedLab
  - lots of cases of pipelines relying on specific old versions of software,
    in at least one cases two different old versions
  - Biology/Bioinformatic applications problematic generally
- EasyBuild
  - regardless of technical merits vs. Spack etc., wins because of the
    community
  - very welcoming, extremely helpful
  - shining example of a distributed open source project working well
  - made my work feasible, and even enjoyable, as opposed to impossible
Ideas for improvement
  - share tips of the founders e.g. hide-deps
  - when to use minimal toolchains, HierarchicalMNS, and when not to
  - adopt some of the third party tools written to e.g. update language extensions
